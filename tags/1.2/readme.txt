Tagline Rotator plugin randomly selects a tagline from a list of user-entered taglines.

== Description ==

The Tagline Rotator plugin does pretty much what it sounds like it would do: it randomly selects a tagline 
(that’s the description of your blog beneath the title) from a list of user-compiled taglines, then displays 
it within your blog. It offers a couple of advantages over some of the other similar plugins I found, most 
importantly that it uses the mySQL database within WordPress, and therefore should not slow down page loads 
significantly. As of version 1.1, it is now WP database prefix compliant, meaning it will use the database prefix stored in your WordPress settings, and should be WPMU compliant.

== Installation ==

Installation of the plugin is a simple three-step process:

   1. Download the plugin and unzip it.
   2. Copy the tagline_rotator.php file to the plugins directory of your WordPress install.
   3. Activate the plugin in the Plugins menu within your admin pages. Taglines can be added through Settings -> Tagline Rotator.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this plugin with wp-cache or a similar caching plugin? =

I have spent some time investigating this question, and while I believe it is possible to maintain a dynamic 
header while using a cache module, it requires including so many headers that it renders the cache relatively 
meaningless. Instead, consider that users will probably see a random tagline each time they visit a new page 
regardless of who cached the tagline.

= Can I use this plugin to rotate any other content on my blog? =

Not right now, but if you ask for something by posting a comment [here](http://neverblog.net/tagline-rotator-plugin-for-wordpress "here"), I'd be happy to work on 
it. I just can't think of anything I need off-hand.

== Known Bugs/Limitations ==
Of course, the current version of this plugin is 1.1, so there are a 
couple of bugs/limitations that you should know about.

    * You must choose ‘Save Changes’ to commit any deletions or additions to the tagline database. Hopefully, this will soon be automated
    * The plugin currently does not delete the tables it creates upon de-activation (that way you don’t lose your taglines). However,
      if you manually delete the table, WordPress will throw an error upon re-activation of the plugin. The easiest way to fix this is to change the option 
      ‘tagline_tables’ in wp_options to be ‘false’ NB: If you’re not comfortable manually editing your mySQL database, don’t worry. The table will just sit there 
      and work if you re-activate the plugin.
    * It still won’t do the dishes.

== Updates ==

Version 0.2 - 7-26-2008 - Fixes an issue where double quotes in a tagline prevent it from being deleted. Thanks to Thorsten for pointing out this bug.
Version 0.3 - 8-25-2008 - Allows you to edit taglines without deleting and recreating them.
Version 0.4b - 3-13-2009 - Allows compatibility with themes which use either the bloginfo() or get bloginfo() function to display the tagline.
Version 1.0 - 3-15-2009 - Allows compatibility with themes which use either the bloginfo() or get bloginfo() function to display the tagline. Has been tested good.
Version 1.1 - 12-31-2009 - Plugin database table is now compliant with WordPress database prefix (i.e. it will use the database prefix set by WP, not the previous wp_tagline_rotator). This should make it WPMU compatible as well, although this is still untested. Upgrading automatically through WordPress from a previous version will also rename the database table to use the correct prefix.
Version 1.2 - 4-18-2010 - Updated UI in Admin Settings to put Save button and add functionality at the top.
